IoT-Based Ultrasonic Vision Glass

The IoT-Based Ultrasonic Vision Glass is an assistive device designed for visually impaired individuals. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and provides audio feedback using a DFPlayer Mini module. This real-time system helps users navigate safely by alerting them about nearby objects through voice messages.

The system continuously monitors the surroundings, measures distances, and plays pre-recorded voice messages based on object proximity. This project aims to enhance mobility and independence for visually impaired users, making navigation safer and more intuitive.

Built using Arduino, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, and DFPlayer Mini, this device is compact, wearable, and easy to use. Future enhancements may include Bluetooth connectivity, AI-based object detection, and vibration feedback for silent alerts.
